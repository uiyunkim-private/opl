fast to slow

We implemented the number of iteration as 1,000,000 to determine the speed of each language.
The result is below: 
ocaml 0.55s user 0.54s system 19% cpu 5.548 total
go   0.77s user 0.88s system 23% cpu 6.876 total
ada  0.41s user 0.54s system 11% cpu 7.984 total
python 1.12s user 0.61s system 18% cpu 9.159 total
prolog 3.71s user 0.65s system 41% cpu 10.593 total

PYTHON
• What was easy?   
    Python is the most familiar language we used.
• What was hard?
    Nothing special
• Are there noticeable differences in speed?
• What do you like/dislike?
• Did you use pattern matching in one or more of your programs? If YES, specify which
one(s), and comment on whether it was easy or hard to make use of pattern matching in
the respective language(s). (You must use pattern matching in at least one of your
programs.)
